# Vault TLS Certificate Rotation Audit

## Your Task

Audit Vault's TLS certificate lifecycle. Find the Go source files in hashicorp/vault that (1) load TLS certificates and key material, (2) watch for or apply certificate rotation and reload events, and (3) rebuild listener or client TLS configuration after the rotation occurs.

## Context

You are working on a codebase task involving repos from the security domain.

## Available Resources

The local `/workspace/` directory contains: hashicorp/vault.

## Output Format

Create a file at `/workspace/answer.json` with your findings in the following structure:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {"repo": "org/repo-name", "path": "relative/path/to/file.go"}
  ],
  "symbols": [
    {"repo": "org/repo-name", "path": "relative/path/to/file.go", "symbol": "SymbolName"}
  ],
  "chain": [
    {"repo": "org/repo-name", "path": "relative/path/to/file.go", "symbol": "FunctionName"}
  ],
  "text": "Narrative explanation of your findings, citing repos and file paths."
}
```

Include only the fields relevant to this task. Your answer is evaluated against a closed-world oracle — completeness matters.

## Evaluation

Your answer will be scored on:
- **File recall and precision**: Did you find all relevant files?
