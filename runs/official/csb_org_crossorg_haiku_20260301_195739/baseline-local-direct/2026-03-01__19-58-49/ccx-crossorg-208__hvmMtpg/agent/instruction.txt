# gRPC Error Status Propagation Across Go Services

## Your Task

Compare how gRPC error status codes are created and propagated in kubernetes/kubernetes vs grafana/grafana vs etcd-io/etcd. Find Go source files in each repo that create gRPC Status errors with codes (codes.NotFound, codes.Internal, etc.) and the files that translate gRPC errors to HTTP responses.

## Context

You are working on a codebase task involving repos from the crossorg domain.

## Available Resources

No local repositories are pre-checked out.

**Note:** Additional repositories are accessible via Sourcegraph MCP tools:
*(none — all repos available locally)*

## Output Format

Create a file at `/workspace/answer.json` with your findings in the following structure:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {"repo": "org/repo-name", "path": "relative/path/to/file.go"}
  ],
  "symbols": [
    {"repo": "org/repo-name", "path": "relative/path/to/file.go", "symbol": "SymbolName"}
  ],
  "chain": [
    {"repo": "org/repo-name", "path": "relative/path/to/file.go", "symbol": "FunctionName"}
  ],
  "text": "Narrative explanation of your findings, citing repos and file paths."
}
```

Include only the fields relevant to this task. Your answer is evaluated against a closed-world oracle — completeness matters.

## Evaluation

Your answer will be scored on:
- **File recall and precision**: Did you find all relevant files?
