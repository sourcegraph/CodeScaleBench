# Deprecated API Detection: Express req.host

## Your Task

Which source files in `sg-evals/expressjs-express` reference the deprecated `req.host` property specifically (the definition, tests, and changelog)? You must verify each hit actually uses `req.host` as a standalone deprecated property, not just as part of the non-deprecated `req.hostname`.

## Context

You are working on a codebase task involving repos from the migration domain.

## Available Resources

No local repositories are pre-checked out.

**Note:** Additional repositories are accessible via Sourcegraph MCP tools:
*(none — all repos available locally)*

## Output Format

Create a file at `/workspace/answer.json` with your findings in the following structure:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {"repo": "org/repo-name", "path": "relative/path/to/file.go"}
  ],
  "symbols": [
    {"repo": "org/repo-name", "path": "relative/path/to/file.go", "symbol": "SymbolName"}
  ],
  "chain": [
    {"repo": "org/repo-name", "path": "relative/path/to/file.go", "symbol": "FunctionName"}
  ],
  "text": "Narrative explanation of your findings, citing repos and file paths."
}
```

Include only the fields relevant to this task. Your answer is evaluated against a closed-world oracle — completeness matters.

## Evaluation

Your answer will be scored on:
- **File recall and precision**: Did you find all relevant files?
